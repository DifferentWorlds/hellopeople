	<h1>The Different Worlds!</h1>
	<pre>Geographically the world may seem the same for everyone....
		but the eye of every being see it differently....it may be like an ocean for some  and  like a drop for other, 
		heaven for some and hell for other, brighter for some and weighter for other...
		all you need is change your perspection! the one who can change your world happier is only "YOU" !the way you see it!
